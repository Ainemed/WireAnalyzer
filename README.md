# WireAnalyzer
In this project, I want to improve my cyber security skills by creating a Wireshark clone.


# ðŸš€ Roadmap to Create a Wireshark Clone

## ðŸŸ¢ Phase 1: Fundamentals and Preparation

### 1. Study How Wireshark Works
- Test Wireshark to understand how it captures and analyzes packets.
- Study common network protocols ([TCP/IP](w), [UDP](w), [HTTP](w), [DNS](w), etc.).
- Analyze packet formats ([Pcap](w) and [PcapNG](w)).

### 2. Choose a Programming Language
- **C/C++** (high efficiency, used by Wireshark).
- **Python** (easier, with libraries like [Scapy](w) or [PyShark](w)).
- **Go/Rust** (modern alternatives with great security and performance).

### 3. Learn How to Capture Packets
- Use [libpcap](w) (for Linux/macOS) or [WinPcap](w)/[Npcap](w) (for Windows).
- Create a small program to capture network packets in real time.

## ðŸŸ¡ Phase 2: Implement Basic Features

### 4. Real-time Packet Capture
- Build an interface to select a network adapter.
- Implement packet capture using `libpcap` or `scapy`.

### 5. Basic Packet Display
- Show basic information (timestamp, protocol, IP/MAC addresses, port).
- Save data to a `.pcap` file for later analysis.

### 6. Basic Protocol Decoding
- Implement a parser for common protocols:
  - **Ethernet, ARP, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, DNS, HTTP**.
- Display packet details in a text-based interface.

---

## ðŸŸ  Phase 3: Feature Enhancements

### 7. Build a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Use **Qt (C++)**, **Tkinter/PyQt (Python)**, or **Electron (JS)** to create a Wireshark-like UI.
- Add a table for clearer packet visualization.

### 8. Advanced Filtering and Searching
- Implement filters for protocols (`tcp`, `udp`, `icmp`, etc.).
- Enable advanced searches (source/destination IP, port, packet content).

### 9. Advanced Decoding and Detailed Analysis
- Support more complex protocols ([TLS](w), [DHCP](w), [SSH](w)).
- Add **packet dissection** (analyze payloads and internal structures).

---

## ðŸ”´ Phase 4: Advanced Features and Optimizations

### 10. Implement Packet Injection (Optional)
- Allow sending custom-crafted packets on the network.
- Use **Scapy (Python)** or **Raw Sockets (C++)** to send packets.

### 11. Performance and Security
- Optimize memory management and CPU usage.
- Protect the tool from **DoS attacks** or **buffer overflow exploits**.

### 12. Export and Integration with Other Tools
- Save and load `.pcap` files.
- Export data in readable formats (CSV, JSON).
- Integrate with other analysis tools (e.g., **ELK Stack**, **Suricata**).

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Goal
- A tool that allows **capturing, filtering, and analyzing packets** in a user-friendly way.
- An interface similar to Wireshark, with advanced features.
- **Efficient and secure code**, usable for educational and research purposes in cybersecurity.
